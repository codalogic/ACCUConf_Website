== A Programmer's Introduction to Chapel

=== Brad Chamberlain


image:/images/2017/Keynotes/BradChamberlain.jpg[Brad Chamberlain image, float="right"]

==== Overview

In this tutorial workshop, I'll present an introduction to Chapel through a combination of short
presentations and hands-on programming sessions (i.e., bring your laptop!).

Over the course of this workshop, you'll be introduced to Chapel's unique language features for tasking and
data parallelism, as well as those for specifying locality and affinity to enable scalability on clusters,
the cloud, and HPC systems.  I'll also provide a brief introduction to Chapel's rich base language, designed
to simplify serial programming as in modern scripting languages (e.g., Python) while preserving the
performance and type safety properties of traditional languages like C and {cpp}.

In the hands-on sessions, you'll be free to explore Chapel features through a combination of prepared
exercises and/or free-form programming – on your laptop and, with luck, even a modern Cray system.

The fine print: Chapel requires a {cpp} compiler, POSIX threads, and a UNIX-like environment.  Thus,
attendees with Linux/*nix, MacOS, or Windows 10 with the Linux bash shell will have the best results.
Alternatives include ssh-ing into such a system, Docker, or Windows with Cygwin.  In short, if you arrive
with access to a system (local or remote) where you can do a 'make'-based compile of a C/{cpp} hello world,
you should be good to go.


==== Bio

Brad Chamberlain is a Principal Engineer at Cray Inc. where he works on parallel programming models. He
serves as the technical lead for the Chapel project which is developing a portable, open-source language for
parallel programming on large-scale systems. In this role, Brad focuses primarily on leading the design and
implementation of the Chapel language with his team at Cray and members of the open-source development
community. Brad received his Ph.D. in Computer Science & Engineering from the University of Washington in
2001 working on the ZPL parallel array language. In the past, he has also worked on languages for embedded
reconfigurable processors and on algorithms for accelerating the rendering of complex 3D scenes.


== The Art of Writing Reasonable Concurrent Code

=== Felix Petriconi

==== Overview

It is indispensable to use multiple cores to get best performance on today's hardware if you cannot use
GPUs. So it is almost unavoidable to write concurrent code. But writing concurrent code is hard. Writing
concurrent code correct and with minimal contention is even harder.

In this hands on tutorial I want to show you how to utilize available CPU cores efficiently in a simple way
by using higher level abstractions like futures and CSP channels, instead of threads and low level
synchronization primitives like atomics and mutex.

After laying a theoretical foundation, I will start with simpler problems, advance to complex use cases and
I will introduce you to abstraction techniques to write at the same time safe, readable, and fast code.

The content of the tutorial is a follow up on Sean Parent's concurrency talks in his series of goals for
better code. I will utilize an open source library that he and I have developed.

You should bring your laptop with a recent C++14 compiler (clang 3.7, gcc 6.1, or Visual Studio 2015 Update
3), boost 1.60.0 and cmake 3.5.1 or newer installed, because there will be lot's of opportunities to
translate the theory into practice.


==== Bio

Felix Petriconi is working as professional programmer since 1993 after he had finished his study of
electrical engineering. He started his career as teacher for intellectually gifted children, freelance
programmer among others in telecommunication and automotive projects. Since 2003 he is employed as
programmer at the MeVis Medical Solutions AG in Bremen, Germany. He is part of a team that develops and
maintains radiological medical devices. His focus is on {cpp} development, training of modern {cpp},
application performance tuning and process improvement. He is a regular speaker at the {cpp} user group in
Bremen, a blog editor at https://isocpp.org and became recently a member of the ACCU's conference committee.




== Moving to C++17: The New Language and Library Features

=== Nico Josuttis

==== Overview

{cpp}17 is the next evolution in modern {cpp} programming. Although it is not as big a step as {cpp}11, it
contains a large number of small and valuable language and library features, which will change the way we
program in {cpp}.

This one-day tutorial presents all the new language and library features in {cpp}17. We’ll cover the
motivation and context of each new feature with examples and background information. We’ll focus on how
these features impact day-to-day programming and how to benefit from them in practice.

Contents:

* History of C++17
* Language features such as
** Structured Bindings
** new control structures
** new features for compile time computing
** minor language features
* Language support features
** uncaught_exceptions()
** new data types any, variant, and optional
** new type traits
** launder()
* Library features
** filesystem library
** parallel STL algorithms
** string_view
** splicing between associative containers
** small library features
* Other bug fixes and notable enhancements
* Effects when combining multiple features


==== Bio

Nicolai Josuttis (www.josuttis.com) is an independent systems architect, technical manager, author, and
consultant. He designs mid-sized and large software systems for the telecommunication, traffic, finance, and
manufacturing industries.

He is well known in the {cpp} Community for speaking and writing with authority about {cpp} (being the
author of 'The C++ Standard Library' and '{cpp} Templates') but is also an innovative presenter.  He is an
active member of {cpp} standardization committee for almost 20 years now.


== Testable architecture

=== Seb Rose

==== Overview


Automated tests and executable specifications can only work with software that has a testable architecture.

A testable architecture enables fast and reliable tests that are easy to write, execute and maintain. Many
organisations have the opposite - slow and unreliable tests that are difficult to write and expensive to
maintain.

During this workshop, we will teach you how to decouple your domain logic from your infrastructure so that
you can test at different levels, with maximum confidence and minimum cost.

You will learn advanced techniques such as ports and adapters (hexagonal architecture), contract testing and
test pyramid - all essential for a testable architecture.

You will learn how to use these techniques with different kinds of architectures such as microservices, SOA
or monolithic systems.


Learning Outcomes:

* Draw and annotate the testing pyramid.
* Be able to identify reasons why teams end up with a top-heavy test-distribution, and explain the consequences.
* Refactor a small part of a system to introduce a port and a concrete adapter.
* Implement a test double that mimics an external system or API.
* Refactor an existing codebase to use a ports & adapters / hexagonal architecture
* Draw a hexagonal architecture diagram for an example codebase.
* List three kinds of feedback that TDD gives you to create a more testable codebase.
* Be able to explain how a Ports & Adapters improves testability in three different ways.
* Create a contract test that can drive both a real and test double adapter for an external component, removing the need for an end-to-end test.
* Enumerate the pros and cons of three different approaches to test data management.
