=== _The Audacity of Chapel: Scalable Parallel Programming Done Right_

Thursday 2017-04-27T09:30+01:00

=== Abstract

Programming language designers have to date largely failed the large-scale parallel computing community, and
arguably even parallel programmers targeting desktops or modest-scale clusters.  Parallel features are
typically an afterthought in language design, tacked on as pragmas, libraries, or extensions.  Even when
languages _are_ designed to support parallelism, they generally fail to consider distributed-memory
computing.  Other approaches tend to be domain-specific and not suited for more general parallel
programming.  Meanwhile, though the High Performance Computing (HPC) community has pursued many novel
parallel languages, none have succeeded in getting over the tipping point of broad adoption.

Chapel is my team's effort to reverse these trends.  It's a general-purpose language in which scalable
parallel programming has been a motivating theme from day one.  It's designed with productivity in mind in
order to make parallel programming less arcane and more modern in style.  It's portable and open-source in
order to support a broad community and reduce barriers to adoption.  And yet, like any new language design
being undertaken by a modest-sized team, it's not without its challenges – both technical and social.

In this talk, I'll provide an introduction to Chapel's motivating themes and features to give you a sense of
what we are doing and why.  I'll also provide a glimpse into some of the challenges we wrestle with and how
we are dealing with them.  Whether you leave the talk a convert to Chapel or simply intrigued, I hope to
challenge you to think about scalable parallelism as the first-class language feature that it deserves
to be.

Brad Chamberlain is a Principal Engineer at Cray Inc. where he works on parallel programming models. He
serves as the technical lead for the Chapel project which is developing a portable, open-source language for
parallel programming on large-scale systems. In this role, Brad focuses primarily on leading the design and
implementation of the Chapel language with his team at Cray and members of the open-source development
community. Brad received his Ph.D. in Computer Science & Engineering from the University of Washington in
2001 working on the ZPL parallel array language. In the past, he has also worked on languages for embedded
reconfigurable processors and on algorithms for accelerating the rendering of complex 3D scenes.

=== _AI: Actual Intelligence_

=== Abstract

It has been said, to err is human, to really foul things up requires a computer [citation needed]. Given the
long tradition of AI, which sometimes attempts to make a sentient being from hardware, or body parts (think
Frankenstein’s monster), are humans unique, or is this dream possible? Or desirable?

Intelligence is also used to mean information the state or businesses gather on you; this is increasingly
done by machine. We frequently have to prove who we are by stating Mother’s maiden names, passwords, even
swiping fingerprints. Much of this is processed by machine, powered by algorithms.  What if they don’t
believe we are who we say we are?

There is more to intelligence than an algorithm. Your thoughts have a context; belief systems, experience,
insight, thinking, learning. SciFi offers Asimov's law of robots. Clearly first order logic isn't enough.
Obviously brute force isn't intelligence. So what is? Do we need it to run on hardware? Conversely, could we
exist in cyberspace without a body? Where will it end?

After graduating from Leeds University with a B.A. in Mathematics and Philosophy, she worked as a
mathematics and IT secondary school teacher, eventually ending up as a programmer. During this time she
obtained an M.Sc. in Pure Mathematics with the Open University, and then returned to Leeds University, to
study for a PhD in data mining to predict how toxic organic chemicals might be. Between then and now, she
has worked in various companies in London with a finance focus.

She has talked and written about various ways to program your way out of a paper bag, providing a gentle
introduction to some machine learning approaches, while trying to keep up to date with new techniques.

=== _Something(s) New in C++_

Saturday 2017-04-29T16:30+01:00

=== Abstract

By the time the ACCU 2017 conference begins, {cpp}17 is expected to be technically complete and in its final
approval ballot. What comes next? Will {cpp} continue growing forever? Can {cpp} code be simplified? This is a
brand-new talk of material I've never given before, in which I'll present one (or more) of three proposals
I'm personally working on to further improve {cpp} post-{cpp}17. All follow a common theme – adding a strategic
language and/or library feature to {cpp} that leads to significant, and sometimes dramatic, simplification of
real-world {cpp} code. I'll pick which one (or more) of those topics to present sometime in March – watch for
this title and abstract to be replaced with more specific information at least one month before the ACCU
2017 conference begins.

=== Bio

Herb Sutter is the chair of the ISO {cpp} committee and a native languages architect at
Microsoft. Organizationally, he has overseen the development of all ISO {cpp}-related specifications except
for the original {cpp}98 standard. Technically, he has been the lead- or co-designer of many standard {cpp}
features, including lambda functions, forwarding constructors, enum class, nullptr, override/final, parallel
algorithms, structured bindings, and other features. He is currently working on finding ways to further
evolve {cpp} so that using {cpp} can be more consistent and simpler, even as the language continues to gain
even greater expressive power and efficiency.

=== _To hell and back: One guitarist's journey through modern software development_

Wednesday 2017-04-26T09:30+01:00

=== Abstract


Microservices are hell, quite literally. As architectural styles go, rarely has a style asked so much from
the developers who are tasked with building systems.

In this talk Russ Miles will be joined by his colleagues, Gibson and the Bot, to talk about the nature of
this hell and how they're working to overcome it using new tools, approaches and, yes, languages."
